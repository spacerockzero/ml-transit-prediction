# **Predicting Shipping Transit Times**

## Using Machine Learning & Gradient Boosting

Our shipping data is more valuable than we realize...

## **Jakob Anderson**

I've been building Machine Learning & other AI software for over 5 years, other software for 30 years.

**AI & ML Apps that:**

- Write stories
- Compose music
- Remix image styles
- Invent phrases
- Detect plagiarism

---

## The Problem

**Traditional shipping estimates fail:**

- Based on simple lookup tables
- Inaccurate (Â±2-3 days variance)
- Lead to customer dissatisfaction
- Can't handle real-world complexity like weekends, holidays, days of the week, seasonal shifts

**Business Impact:**

- Lost revenue from missed deliveries
- Higher customer support costs
- Poor operational planning

---

## Our Solution

**73% more accurate predictions using ML**

| Metric   | Traditional | ML-Based   | Improvement    |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Accuracy | Â±2.5 days   | Â±0.68 days | **73% better** |

**How it works:**
Historical Data â†’ Feature Engineering â†’ LightGBM â†’ Predictions

**Powered by:** 29,000+ shipments, 15+ features, gradient boosting

---

## How Gradient Boosting Works

**Builds trees sequentially, each correcting previous errors**

**Why LightGBM?**

- Handles complex patterns automatically
- Fast: 10-50ms per prediction (cached)
- Robust to missing data
- Production-ready

**Key Features Used:**

- Temporal patterns (day/month)
- Routes & carrier combinations
- Seasonal historical trends
- Package characteristics

---

## ðŸš€ Increases Productivity

**Before:** Carrier estimates, often missing during label purchase, or don't always accommodate for seasons, weekends, zones
**After:** Data-driven predictions for better carrier comparison

**Benefits:**

- Additional metric for rate shopping decisions
- Compare predicted transit times across carriers
- Make informed tradeoffs between cost and speed
- Batch processing for large shipment volumes

---

## âœ¨ Improves Work Quality

**Precision & Reliability:**

- 73% more accurate predictions
- Uncertainty ranges (best/expected/worst case)
- Data-driven decision making
- Statistical distribution analysis

**Results:**

- Fewer missed delivery windows
- More accurate customer promises
- Better resource allocation

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Unlocks New Capabilities

**Uncertainty Quantification:**

- Best case: 2.1 days
- Expected: 3.2 days
- Worst case: 4.8 days

**New Services:**

- Offer guaranteed delivery windows
- Real-time analytics dashboard
- Carrier performance comparison
- Paid API for third-party apps

---

## ðŸ’° Makes Money

**Speculative Business Value of Accurate Predictions:**

- Paid service for third-party apps. Use predictions from our shipping data as a valuable resource to inform other's decisions.
- Avoid costly late deliveries and lost sales.
- Prevent loss of customer trust and reduce the need for service credits or refunds.
- Less wasted resources, fewer emergency shipments, and improved inventory management.
- On-time shipments can be a key differentiator in competitive markets.
- Loss aversion: Businesses are more sensitive to losses from missed deadlines than to gains from faster deliveryâ€”ML helps minimize these risks.

**Bottom Line:**

- Accurate transit time prediction is a strategic asset that protects revenue, reduces operational losses, and enables new business opportunities.

---

## Beyond Transit Time: Future Opportunities

**Logistics:**

- Demand forecasting for resource planning
- If we know which carriers/levels slow down for each season, we can route shipments to those that don't slow down
- Dynamic pricing based on capacity

**Business Intelligence Uses for Data Mining & ML predictions:**

- Customer churn prediction
- Fraud detection with real-time scoring
- Risk assessments
- Many other paid api prediction services using historical shipping data

## Next Steps

**Current System:**
âœ… Trained models with 73% better accuracy than carrier prediction
âœ… REST API
âœ… Analytics dashboard deployed

**Your Pilot Project:**

1. Integrate with your shipment data
2. live proof of concept, showing informative estimate
3. Measure ROI on real shipments
4. Scale across operations
