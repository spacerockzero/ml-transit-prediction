## How Gradient Boosting Works

**Gradient Boosting Decision Trees:**

1. Build ensemble of decision trees sequentially
2. Each tree corrects errors from previous trees
3. Handles complex non-linear relationships automatically
4. Fast training & inference (10-50ms per prediction)

**Why LightGBM?**

- âœ… Handles categorical features natively
- âœ… Robust to missing data
- âœ… Captures feature interactions automatically
- âœ… Prevents overfitting with regularization
- âœ… Production-ready performance
