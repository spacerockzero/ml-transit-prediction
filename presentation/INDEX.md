**Pro tip**: Adjust timing based on audience. Executives want more on slides 7-13, engineers want more on slides 4-6.

## 🎨 Customization

### Edit the Presentation

1. Open `ml-transit-prediction.md` in any text editor
2. Modify content (it's just markdown + Marp directives)
3. Rebuild: `marp ml-transit-prediction.md --pdf`

### Change Theme

Edit front matter in markdown file:

```yaml
---
theme: gaia # or default, uncover
backgroundColor: #123456
---
```

See [Marp themes](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core/tree/main/themes) for options.
