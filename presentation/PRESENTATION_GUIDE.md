- ROI is compelling and defensible

### Future Opportunities (14-19)

**Slide 14-19: Beyond Transit**

- 12 opportunities organized by category
- Each is a separate project with its own ROI
- Key message: This is a platform, not just a tool

**Top 3 to emphasize:**

1. **Demand forecasting** - Plan better, reduce waste
2. **Dynamic pricing** - Revenue optimization goldmine
3. **Predictive maintenance** - Prevent costly failures

### Closing (20-25)

**Slide 20: Implementation Roadmap**

- Phase 1 is done—we have working system
- Phases 2-3 show we've thought ahead
- This is a journey, not a one-time project

**Slide 21: Technology Stack**

- Modern, proven technologies
- No vendor lock-in (open source)
- Easy to hire for/maintain

**Slide 22: Metrics**

- Track what matters: accuracy, business impact, technical performance
- Show we're data-driven about being data-driven

**Slide 23: Conclusion**

- Discuss slides 14-19 (future opportunities)
- Talk about competitive advantage
- Show market differentiation potential

## Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: How much data do you need?**
A: We started with 29K records. In production, you'd want 6-12 months of real data. Can start with less and improve over time.

**Q: What if we don't have historical data?**
A: Can use synthetic data for proof-of-concept, then switch to real data. We've done this—it works.

**Q: How often do models need retraining?**
A: Monthly initially, then quarterly once stable. We have automated pipelines.

**Q: What about data privacy/security?**
A: All data stays in your infrastructure. No external APIs. GDPR/CCPA compliant.

**Q: Can this integrate with our existing systems?**
A: Yes! REST API design. We have examples for SAP, Oracle, Shopify integrations.

**Q: What's the learning curve for our team?**
A: API usage is simple (send JSON, get predictions). Model maintenance requires some ML knowledge, but we provide training.

**Q: How do you handle edge cases?**
A: Ensemble with fallbacks. Quantile predictions give confidence intervals. Alert system for unusual patterns.

**Q: What about international shipping?**
A: Current model is US domestic (USPS zones). International is future opportunity #12 on slide 19.

**Q: Cloud or on-premise?**
A: Both! ONNX models are portable. Currently runs on Node.js—deploy anywhere.

**Q: What's your accuracy on long-distance shipments?**
A: Zone 9 (cross-country): MAE of 0.75 days. Still 70%+ better than traditional estimates.

## Demo Tips

If doing a live demo:

1. Show API call with curl/Postman
2. Display prediction + quantiles
3. Open dashboard, show analytics
4. Compare 2-3 service levels side-by-side
5. Highlight <50ms response time

Keep demo under 5 minutes. Practice beforehand.

## Presentation Timing

- Total: 30 minutes + 10 min Q&A
- Slides 1-6: 8 minutes (intro + technical)
- Slides 7-13: 12 minutes (business value—most important)
- Slides 14-19: 7 minutes (future opportunities)
- Slides 20-24: 3 minutes (closing)
- Buffer for questions throughout

## Post-Presentation Follow-Up

1. Send PDF + Executive Summary
2. Schedule technical deep dive (if interested)
3. Offer pilot project proposal
